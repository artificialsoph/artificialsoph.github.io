        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Last week I presented at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171018141234/https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Data-Science-Study-Group/events/243747107/">Data Science Study Group</a> on a project of mine where I built a deep learning platform from scratch in python.</p>

<p>For reference, here’s my <a href="https://github.com/sophiaray/sophscratch">code</a> and <a href="http://soph.info/scratch.pdf">slides</a>.</p>

<p>First, my project drew primarily from two sets of sources, without which I never would have completed this project. First, there are many examples of folks doing this online. Here’s an incomplete list in python:</p>

<ul>
  <li>** <a href="http://www.deepideas.net/deep-learning-from-scratch-i-computational-graphs/">Deep Learning From Scratch I-V</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/deepideas_net">Daniel Sabinasz</a> **</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/">Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch in Python – An Introduction</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/dennybritz">Denny Britz</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-and-r/">Understanding and coding Neural Networks From Scratch in Python and R</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/sunil2ray?lang=en">Sunil Ray</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/">How to Implement the Backpropagation Algorithm From Scratch In Python</a></li>
</ul>

<p>While all of these are useful, Sabinasz’s was what I based my project on because he implements a system that builds a computational graph and includes a true backpropogation algorithm. The others I saw do this implicitly by calculating the gradients operation-by-operation. That approach is fine for a single demo but I wanted something that mimicked the flexibility of tensorflow, allowing me to compare different network structures and activations without starting over each time.</p>

<p>In addition to these resources, I drew heavily from <a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning</a> by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. I’m certain that the other examples I looked toward used this book as well.</p>

<p>While I started with Sabinasz’s code, I made a few modifications and improvements including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add graph visualization with <a href="http://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html">python Graphviz</a></li>
  <li>Remove the use of globals for the computational graph</li>
  <li>Simplify backprop algorithm by adding gradient calculations to the operation classes</li>
  <li>Add a Relu activation function</li>
  <li>Tweak the visualizations</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the learning rate plotted along with the classification boundary for a relu network with 4 hidden nodes.

<p>And here’s the computational graph. You can really see the benefit of tracking the graph and automating the backprop algorithm for a graph of this size.

<h2>What I still want to do</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I want to write up a blog summarizing my talk and the process for creating this. I think it could be a very useful explanatory tool.</li>
  <li>I have a strong feeling that some of the gradients in here are inaccurate.
    <ul>
      <li>In many cases the network fails to learn for any learning rate schedule unless I give it a much higher capacity than it needs (e.g. 4+ hidden nodes in the XOR task).</li>
      <li>In simple cases, like separable data, the model should be able to get arbitrarily close to $J=0$ but fails to do so.</li>
      <li>The softmax gradient seems to differ from that found in other sources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I want to extend this model to larger datasets and deeper networks. Right now it runs into what I think are underflow errors in these cases but they should be possible to avoid.</li>
</ol>

          <p>Trans friends, here’s a periodic reminder that it might be useful to update your documents (name, gender marker, id). I’ve recently done this. Here’s the quickest and cheapest path for US citizens:</p>

<p>1 <strong>Update your passport gender marker.</strong> For this you need proof of citizenship (like a birth certificate), a letter from your doctor, and a new passport photo. Use the template in the link below. The cost is $110 and this can be done in one or two days. <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/gender.html">info here</a>
2 <strong>Update your name in court.</strong> This process differs state by state. Roughly, you’ll schedule a hearing, gather documents including a birth certificate, publish an announcement in the paper (trans folks are generally able to waive the publication requirement in NY), then get certified copies of the court order <a href="https://srlp.org/resources/namechange/">NYC</a>, <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/CourtHelp/DIY/nameChange.shtml">NY</a>, <a href="https://slwordpress.rutgers.edu/socialjustice/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2016/08/NJ-Name-Gender-Change-Guide-for-Residents-v1-1.pdf">NJ</a>
3 <strong>Update your passport name.</strong> Do this within a year of step one and it’s free and only requires the court order (<a href="https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds5504.pdf">form here</a>).
4 Everything else (except sometimes a birth certificate) can be done with an updated passport and possibly some additional documentation.</p>

<p>If you need help, I’d love to or help find someone who can. If money is a problem, <a href="https://www.transassistance.org">Trans Assistance Project</a>, <a href="http://tldef.org">TLDEF</a>, <a href="https://srlp.org">SRLP</a>, and other places have provided that in the past. Let me know if you have any trouble.</p>
