Hey all!

I wanted to give a few parting words as the dust from the last twelve weeks is starting to settle. First of all, I can't say enough how grateful I am to have been one of your instructors. I've loved getting to know you, watching you learn and grow, and learning from you. I can't wait to see what's next for each of you.

I believe I've said this already but just to reiterate, beyond the amazing support that Metis offers through careers and our slack channels, I also make myself available to students. You have my email (s@soph.info) if you ever need something. Especially:

- Career/project advice.
- Mock interviews.
- Recommendations (you can request this on LinkedIn).
- Someone to remind you that you've got what it takes to be an awesome data scientist!

Finally, there's a favor I want to ask. Feedback is super important to us at Metis. You should have gotten an email linking you to an end of cohort survey. Please fill that out as soon as you get the chance. Let us know what we got right and if there's anything that could've been better. We work really hard to make the bootcamp as good as it can be, and that work is always going to be best when it's informed by you.

Related to that, Metis depends a lot on our reviews on external sites (perhaps some of you found out about us or researched us on one of these). It would mean a lot of you could share your thoughts about the bootcamp on Course Report (https://www.coursereport.com/schools/metis#/reviews) and/or SwitchUp (https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/metis).

Anyway, ya'll mean a lot to me. Stay in touch
-Soph
