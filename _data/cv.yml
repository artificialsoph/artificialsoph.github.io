      Metis is an award-winning Data Science Bootcamp—currently the only such bootcamp that is accredited. The 12 week bootcamp is a project-based curriculum that covers the breadth of the field of Data Science.
    milestones:
      - "**Curriculum Design**: led curriculum revision team of 15 Senior Data Scientists. Coverage includes introductory materials through advanced modeling and big data. Curriculum is the primary product for the bootcamp business (\\\\$4M revenue per yr) and the basis for major corporate training contracts (multiple \\\\$300k pilots with \\\\$1M/yr option)."
      - "**Learning management system** (LMS): was primary developer of a new internal LMS which managed lesson planning, deployment of content to students, grading and access to solutions. The LMS standardized content across the company and enabled company-wide metrics for first time."
      - "**Management and coordination**: Introduced industry best-practices including company-wide prioritization meetings, code reviews, and continuous integration. Oversaw increase in internal collaboration: year over year 7x (commits) and 20x (issues/pull requests). Managed codebase, resolving disputes between ICs and overseeing product development."
      - "**Instruction**: Taught and mentored 100s of students entering data science. Written dozens of lessons including: SVMs, Data Science Ethics, Deep Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks."
