experience:
  - company: Metis
    website: https://www.thisismetis.com/
    location: New York, NY
    role: Senior Data Scientist, Curriculum Lead
    dates: 2017-
    description: |
      Metis is an award-winning Data Science Bootcamp—currently the only such bootcamp that is accredited. The 12 week bootcamp is a project-based curriculum that covers the breadth of the field of Data Science.
    milestones:
      - "**Curriculum Design**: led curriculum revision and development team of 15 Senior Data Scientists. Coverage includes introduction materials through advanced modeling and big data. Curriculum is the primary product for the bootcamp business (300 students, \\\\$4M revenue per yr) and the basis for major corporate training contracts ($300k pilot with \\\\$1M/yr option)."
      - "**Management and coordination**: Brought industry best-practices to a data science startup that lacked them including companywide prioritization meetings, code reviews, pull request workflow, and continuous integration. These changes led to major improvement for collaboration on internal codebase: year over year increase of 7x (commits) and 20x (issues/pull requests)."
      - "**Learning management system**: built a command-line tool to serve as an LMS. Managed lesson planning, deployment to students, grading and providing of solutions. Used in 4 campuses, by 15+ instructors and 300+ students per year. The LMS stadardized content across the company and enabled company-wide metrics for first time."
      - "**Instruction**: Taught and mentored >100 students as they changed careers to data science. Authored new lessons for: Code Style, Computational Complexity, SVMs, Data Science Ethics, Deep Learning Intro, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks."
