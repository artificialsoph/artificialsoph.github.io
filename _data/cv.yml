    location: Remote
    role: Director of Data Science, Digital Supply Networks
    dates: 2021-

      Data Science team that supports Merchandising, Operations, Logistics and Client experience. Built and managed capabilities that power inventory and supply chain decisions from Purchase Order, real time availability, to returns optimization. Our work has been discussed in [Vogue Business](https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/events/how-stitch-fix-is-using-ai-to-predict-trends) and [SFIX Earnings calls](https://investors.stitchfix.com/events/event-details/q3-fy24-stitch-fix-earnings-conference-call).
    milestones:
      - "**AI Buying Tool**: Built buying recommendation platform that uses personalization to inform buying decisions. Has driven improvements in inventory performance  (unit turn, GMROI). Since scaling in early 2023, the tool is used to inform 80+% of orders for known SKUs and is driving $38M/yr in incremental revenue. Extensions have incorporated stylist selection trends (early 2024), personalized size and fit data (mid 2024), and support for first-time test buys of SKUs (late 2024). Project consolidated dozens of Merch tools into signle platform, increased development velocity, reduced suport burden of team to 1/3."
      - "**Returns in Transit**: Multi-year effort rebuilt inventory and order management to enabled offering returns in transit for sale. RIT is driving $24M/yr of incremental revenue, a 2% reduction in return rates, and increses in active clientws and repeat purchases."
      - "**Product Lifecycle Management**: Pioneered approach to balancing sellthrough of excess inventory with personalization of recommendations. Enabled reduction of aged inventory from 62% at peak to 22% today while reducing reliance on markdowns and liquidation, ultimately *increasing* gross margin."
