Hi I'm talking at AI TRAPS in Berlin. I hope to expand this material into a longer-form piece soon but until then, the slides are below. Disruption Lab says there'll be a livestream, so watch their social media around 4pm (Berlin) 10am (NYC).

There's a ton of impressive folks at this event so be sure to check them out.
