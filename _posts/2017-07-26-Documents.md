Trans friends, here's a periodic reminder that it might be useful to update your documents (name, gender marker, id). I've recently done this. Here's the quickest and cheapest path for US citizens:

1 **Update your passport gender marker.** For this you need proof of citizenship (like a birth certificate), a letter from your doctor, and a new passport photo. Use the template in the link below. The cost is $110 and this can be done in one or two days. [info here](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/gender.html)
2 **Update your name in court.** This process differs state by state. Roughly, you'll schedule a hearing, gather documents including a birth certificate, publish an announcement in the paper (trans folks are generally able to waive the publication requirement in NY), then get certified copies of the court order [NYC](https://srlp.org/resources/namechange/), [NY](http://www.nycourts.gov/CourtHelp/DIY/nameChange.shtml), [NJ](https://slwordpress.rutgers.edu/socialjustice/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2016/08/NJ-Name-Gender-Change-Guide-for-Residents-v1-1.pdf)
3 **Update your passport name.** Do this within a year of step one and it's free and only requires the court order ([form here](https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds5504.pdf)).
4 Everything else (except sometimes a birth certificate) can be done with an updated passport and possibly some additional documentation.

If you need help, I'd love to or help find someone who can. If money is a problem, [Trans Assistance Project](https://www.transassistance.org), [TLDEF](http://tldef.org), [SRLP](https://srlp.org), and other places have provided that in the past. Let me know if you have any trouble.
