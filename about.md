data witch to watch out for \| âš§

Some of my primary interests include:
- *Ethics in Data Science*: I work advance the field's approach to ethics in the present day and to understand the often dark history of the field.
- *Deep Learning applications*: audio recognition, sequence processing, image recognition.
- *Education and Computational Psychology*: computational and theoretical accounts of how people and agents intentionally communicate in order to teach and learn.
